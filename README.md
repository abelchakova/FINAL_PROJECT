## Introduction

Driven by a passion for data analytics and real estate, I embarked on this project after earning my certification from Ironhack Paris. Inspired by a friend's upcoming move to Madrid, I aimed to uncover data-driven insights into the Madrid real estate market. This analysis seeks to guide decision-making for buyers and stakeholders and assist my friend in finding their dream home.

## Data Collection

- **Primary Dataset**: Sourced from Kaggle, titled "Madrid Real Estate Market," containing extensive information from online property advertisements.
- **Supplementary Data**: Web scraping efforts from Wikipedia to gather additional information, such as the population and area of each district in Madrid.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Conducted EDA using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Analyzed data distributions, identified patterns, and detected anomalies.
- Prepared datasets for further analysis through data wrangling and cleaning.

## Machine Learning Models

- Developed predictive machine learning models for property prices using regression analysis.
- Utilized various algorithms like KNN, Bagging, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, and XGBoost.
- Performed hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

## Interactive Visualization

- Created an interactive map of Madrid in Tableau.
- Overcame geocoding challenges to accurately visualize property locations and market dynamics.

## API Development

- Developed an API using Flask for efficient data retrieval.
- The API allows for flexible data access based on user-specified criteria, enhancing the usability of the real estate database.

## Challenges Faced

- Initial geocoding plan was limited by service constraints (2,500 requests limit, slow processing).
- Alternative approach using zip codes failed to yield accurate results.
- Successfully utilized a spatial file of Madrid to create an interactive map in Tableau.

## Conclusion

This project provided deep insights into the Madrid real estate market, highlighting the impact of various features on property prices and offering neighborhood comparisons. It was an interesting and challenging endeavor, and I hope it helps my friend find the perfect house in Madrid.
